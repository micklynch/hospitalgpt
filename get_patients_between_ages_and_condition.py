def get_patients_between_ages_and_condition(min_age: int, max_age: int, condition: str) -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, int, None]]]:
    '''
    Fetches and returns a list of patients from a specified FHIR R4 API endpoint based on the patients' age range and condition.
    
    Parameters:
    min_age (int): The minimum age to filter patients by. It returns only patients older than or equal to this age.
    max_age (int): The maximum age to filter patients by. It returns only patients younger than this age.
    condition (str): The specific health condition to filter patients by. It returns only patients who have this condition.

    Returns:
    An array of dictionary where each dictionary represents a patient and contains the patient's full name, age, MRN, email address, and condition.

    Example usage:
    >>> get_patients_between_ages_and_condition(50, 70, "Myocardial")
    This will return all patients who are between the ages of 50 and 70 (inclusive) and who have a condition with the name containing 'Myocardial'.
